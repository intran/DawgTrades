The purpose of this project is to create a simple auction site dedicated to UGA students. The process uses the software lifecycle where the group had to plan both Requirement and Design Analysis documents before writing the code. The majority of the code is written Java, with the website in HTML. MySQL was used as the primary database with the application hosted on a JBoss server.
