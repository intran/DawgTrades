The purpose of this project is to create a simple auction site dedicated to UGA students. The process uses the software lifecycle where the group had to plan both Requirement and Design Analysis documents before writing the code. The majority of the code is written Java, with the website in HTML. MySQL was used as the primary database with the application hosted on a JBoss server.

The purpose of this project was to create an iOS application to help college students find peers to form and maintain small study groups. It focused on promoting good user-centered design. Jakob Nielsen's heuristic design as well as user input was used to develop this application. The project was coded in Objective C using XCode.

The project was split into 4 major milestones: finding a good topic, creating different prototypes, picking and designing a prototype, and user testing. Each member was tasked to write a milestone, with myself doing the third.

## Screenshots
The image below shows the **login screen** of when starting. The application would use the university's student data to sync the student's classes when logged in. This not only give an easier way to login, but also facilitate the user by not having them remember an extra login information.

The image below shows the **home screen** of the application. Here, the user can go to their profile (not shown in these previews) by pressing the top right corner, exit (top left), and choose a class. Names are hidden for privacy.

The image below shows the **groups page** for a certain class. Here, the user can find and sort groups regarding to the class, look up class information, create a group, join or group, or go back to the home screen.

The image below shows the **class information page**. Here, the user can look up specific details regarding the class they are taking. Names are hidden for privacy.

The image below shows the **join page**. The user can join/leave the group after picking a group from the groups page. The user can also tap on another username to go to their profile page (not shown in the previews) to see if they both share classes with one another.

The image below shows when a user **create a group**. The application asks the user a few details before a group can be created. The user can re-use tags to describe the group, or apply new ones. One feature that we did not implement (but wanted to) was the ability for the user to leave the date and time field blank to create a group at the current time rather than in advanced.

This purpose of this project is to create a working calculator in Java that can both use iterative (normal) and recursive (reusing a simpler operator until the solution is reached) operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and factorial. The calculator is also able to logical left and right shift, clear, and delete numbers. The calculator is skinned using CSS to emulate a NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) controller. Another function that was implemented was the ability to directly use binary bits as part of operations. Changing the binary values will also change the corresponding number value.

This image shows a simple operation. The binary bits are shown below the number (although that is the incorrect binary representation).

This image shows what happens when the operation cannot be done logically. The binary values are also toggled off in this image.
